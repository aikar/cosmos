# Cosmos
## About
 Cosmos is a distributed Event Driven and RPC style application development framework for Node.JS.
Cosmos is designed to be similiar to the concepts behind Erlang, but for Node.JS

It is still in the early stages of development and should not be used by anyone... not even for development! at least not yet!
