# Cosmos
## About
Cosmos is a distributed Event Driven and RPC style application development framework for Node.JS.

Cosmos is designed to be similiar to the concepts behind Erlang OTP, but for Node.JS

Applications are built in a purely event driven style, backed behind message brokers such as Kafka, RabbitMQ, or others, letting you design your application to be ready to scale out and scale dynamically.
