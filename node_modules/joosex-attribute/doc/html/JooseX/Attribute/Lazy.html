<h1 id="description">DESCRIPTION</h1>

<p>Joose lets you defer attribute population by making an attribute lazy (see the <a href="#synopsis" title="SYNOPSIS">Synopsis</a> for syntax) </p>

<p>When <code>lazy</code> flag is set, the default is not generated until the getter method is called, rather than at object construction time. 
There are several reasons you might choose to do this.</p>

<p>First, if the default value for this attribute depends on some other attributes, then the attribute must be lazy. 
During object construction, defaults are not generated in a predictable order, so you cannot count on some other attribute being populated when generating a default.</p>

<p>Second, there's often no reason to calculate a default before it's needed. Making an attribute lazy lets you defer the cost until the attribute is needed. 
If the attribute is never needed, you save some CPU time.</p>
