                someAttribuute : {

        var instance = new Some.Class()

        instance.triggerCalled == false //trigger wasn't called yet

<h1 id="description">DESCRIPTION</h1>

<p><code>JooseX.Attribute.Trigger</code> is a role, which triggers a function call, after an attribute was changed via setter call.</p>

<p>It is called as a method (in the scope of the instance), and receives the new value as 1st argument, and old value as 2nd. </p>

<p>Trigger is also called when an attribute's value is passed to the constructor.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>, that trigger will not be called for the value of attribute's <code>init</code> option, as it only translates the value to the prototype of the class </p>
