<p>JooseX.Attribute.Delegate - map a method to the method of the attribute </p>

<h1 id="synopsis">SYNOPSIS</h1>

<pre><code>        Class('Some.Class', { 

            has : {

                someAttr1 : {
                    handles : 'commonMethod'
                },

                // or

                someAttr2 : {
                    handles : [ 'commonMethod1', 'commonMethod2' ]
                },

                // or

                someAttr3 : {
                    handles : {
                        classMethod : 'attributeMethod'
                    }
                }
            }
        })

        var instance = new Some.Class()


        var a = instance.classMethod('foo', 'bar')
        var b = instance.commonMethod('bar', 'baz') 

        // eqivalent to

        var a = instance.someAttr3.attributeMethod('foo', 'bar')
        var b = instance.someAttr1.commonMethod('bar', 'baz')

<h1 id="whatisdelegation">WHAT IS DELEGATION?</h1>

<p>Delegation is a feature that lets you create "proxy" methods that do nothing more than call some other method on an attribute. 
This is quite handy since it lets you simplify a complex set of "has-a" relationships and present a single unified API from one class.</p>

<p>With delegation, consumers of a class don't need to know about all the objects it contains, reducing the amount of API they need to learn.</p>

<p>Delegations are defined as a mapping between one or more methods provided by the "real" class (the delegatee), and a set of corresponding methods in the delegating class. 
The delegating class can re-use the method names provided by the delegatee or provide its own names.</p>

<h1 id="definingamapping">DEFINING A MAPPING</h1>

<p>In the simplest form mapping is a string, which corresponds to the proxy method name.</p>

<pre><code>    has : {
        someAttr : 'method'
    }
</code></pre>

<p>Its possible to specify an array with the method names:</p>

<pre><code>    has : {
        someAttr : {
            handles : [ 'method1', 'method2' ]
        }
    }
</code></pre>

<p>For each array entry, in the class consuming the attribute, will be created a proxy method. This method will delegate to the method of the attribute with the same name.</p>

<p>Its possible to rename methods during mapping, supplying the mapping value as object:</p>

<pre><code>    has : {
        someAttr : {

            handles : {
                proxyMethod : 'methodOfTheAttribute'
            }
        }
    }
</code></pre>
