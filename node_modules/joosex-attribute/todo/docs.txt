/**



Constructor parameters (init_arg)

By default, each attribute can be passed by name to the class's constructor. On occasion, you may want to use a different name for the constructor parameter. You may also want to make an attribute unsettable via the constructor.

Both of these goals can be accomplished with the init_arg option:

  has 'bigness' => (
      is       => 'ro',
      init_arg => 'size',
  );

Now we have an attribute named "bigness", but we pass size to the constructor.

Even more useful is the ability to disable setting an attribute via the constructor. This is particularly handy for private attributes:

  has '_genetic_code' => (
      is         => 'ro',
      lazy_build => 1,
      init_arg   => undef,
  );

By setting the init_arg to undef, we make it impossible to set this attribute when creating a new object.
